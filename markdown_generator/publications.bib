   abstract = {To achieve high-density, high-reliability integrated packaging interconnects, 3D packaging technology has become a focus of current research, where Through-Silicon Via (TSV) and Through-Glass Via (TGV) technologies are key interconnect technologies. However, in TSV and TGV structures, the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients among various materials and the complexity of the interconnect structures can lead to significant thermal stress during production and use, severely affecting device performance and reliability. In this study, a thermomechanically coupled phase-field model that considers mixed-mode fracture is proposed to study the mechanical performance and fracture behavior of interconnect structures. The approach to studying coupled thermo-mechanical-damage models can indeed be divided into two parts, focusing first on microstructure generation using Voronoi polygons and second on conducting phase field simulations to analyze mechanical and fracture behaviors. The framework was applied to model the fracture of interconnect structures under thermal cyclic conditions, demonstrating the formation of distinctive crack patterns and complex crack networks. The cracking behaviors observed in the experiments and simulations are remarkably similar to each other. This research provides an efficient and reliable simulation method for enhancing the reliability of interconnect structures in 3D packaging technology.},
